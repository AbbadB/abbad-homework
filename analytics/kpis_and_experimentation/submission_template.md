# Analytics Track KPIs and Experimentation Homework

## User Story

Product: Riot Games Portfolio

For my homework, I'm exploring the user journey through Riot Games' diverse portfolio, starting with their iconic League of Legends, which I've been playing since 2012. This 5v5 strategic battle game initially drew me in with its competitive edge and dynamic gameplay. Over the years, I've navigated the complexities of mastering various characters and delving deeper into its rich strategic layers, making each game a unique and engaging experience.

While I haven't ventured into Valorant, Riot's entry into the first-person shooter genre, TeamFight Tactics captivated me with its strategic auto-battler format. Here, the journey shifted from real-time action in League of Legends to a more deliberate, tactical approach in TFT. This game stands out for its emphasis on individual strategy, where success depends solely on my decisions, a contrast to the team-based dynamics of League of Legends.

Riot's innovation extends beyond gaming, mirroring Apple's strategy of perfecting rather than pioneering. Their League of Legends series 'Arcane' on Netflix is a testament to this, expanding the game's universe into other media and attracting new audiences, including my previously uninterested fiancé. This broadening of the LoL universe deepened my engagement with the game and its lore.

The foray into music with virtual bands like KDA and Heartsteel, featuring collaborations with real artists, further enriches the user journey by blending gaming with popular culture. Riot's ability to intertwine gaming with music and storytelling has significantly enhanced the overall experience.

The immersive experience continues with the League of Legends World Championships. These events, streamed with detailed analytics, bring a sports-like excitement, offering a new dimension of engagement for someone like me who isn't traditionally a sports fan.

Riot's Wild Rift, adapting League of Legends for mobile and console play, has been a game-changer, especially for newcomers like my fiancé. It simplifies the LoL experience without losing its essence, making the game more accessible and expanding the user journey into new platforms.

Looking forward, Riot's development of a MMORPG set in the League of Legends universe is highly anticipated. Based on my journey with their previous titles, I'm excited to see how this new game will add another layer to the rich tapestry of experiences Riot Games offers. Their consistent delivery of quality and innovation keeps me engaged and eager for what's next in the League universe.
